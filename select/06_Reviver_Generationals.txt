I never said I'd go home with or without you
When I do I see you out but you don't talk to me
And any time I catch myself, I'm about to
And either way my heart's with you and I know not to be
Standing by in the beginning, you were the sole survivor
Down here in the middle, you are the only reviver

I was around to hear you say you'd be the first one in the room
I liked to watch you lead the way even when you don't know where to go
I know you get all misty when you think you don't know what you need
There's twenty-thousand ways to let me know you don't believe in destiny

Standing by in the beginning, you were the sole survivor
Down here in the middle, you are the only reviver

Down here in the middle
