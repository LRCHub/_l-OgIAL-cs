I do not remember when I heard your voice last time
Everything used to be alright, but it could be broken with no mercy

I can't hold you tight now
I lose everything you made

Sitting alone in my room, I didn't even know who I was
The more you struggle to step forward,
the worse the despair causes the pain cruelly as you lose everything
I don't want a bad end
I just wanna fight again

The way you wanted is what I want
I felt a pain but I made the way we'll be back again
The way you wanted is what I want
I saw everything that I've tried so hard

Here comes, get back
Open the circle wide for smack
If you wanna die, stand in the middle
Let me ask you, what is your problem

No matter how far we are, I will keep the promise of us
No matter how many times, I get defeated
It can't be broken and it's bigger than before
So take my hands to walk with me

Burn'em down

Make the circle
Show me what you've got

The more you struggle to step forward,
the worse the despair causes the pain cruelly as you lose everything
Oh, I don't want a bad end
No, I just wanna fight again

You hear my voice again and the sorrow is over
The anger inside me is gone now
I put my hands up to lead you forward
The place we've longed for

The way you wanted is what I want
I felt a pain but I made the way we'll be back again
The way you wanted is what I want
I saw everything that I've tried so hard

I put my hands up to lead you forward
The place we have longed for
